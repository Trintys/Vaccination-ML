# Vaccination-ML
For the analysis of vaccinations in Greece in the 3rd exercise, we use plots to display information from the DATASET. Specifically, we use a bar chart to represent the total vaccinations in Thessaloniki and Athens, comparing them as they are the largest cities in Greece. Then, again with plots, we display the daily vaccinations in both cities for the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd doses. Finally, with plot.figure/bar, we show the Top 10 cities with vaccinations per region.
